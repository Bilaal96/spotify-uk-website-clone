# Spotify (UK) Website Clone ðŸŽ¶

A recreation of Spotify's marketing website using HTML, SCSS and JS. This project uses the bundler **Parcel** to compile SCSS to CSS.

## Project Aims

This project helped me to:

- **Practice** implementing the frontend of an application **from an existing design**
- Gain a better understanding of SASS
- Use Parcel to compile SCSS to CSS

## What I Learned

I learned a lot about SASS either through direct implementation or research during this project. The main learning points are:

- SASS allows us to modularise our CSS using partials for an improved development experience and easier maintenance.
- With `dart-sass` `@use` instead of `@import` - as `@import` pollutes the global scope and will be phased out.
- Mixins and Placeholders are useful for grouping styles that are commonly used together, however the CSS output is distinctly different.
- Various combinations of Functions, Loops, Maps and Conditionals can be used to easily generate class variants; e.g. for font-sizes, spacing, breakpoints and more.
